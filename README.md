# comp6771

## Introduction
Project implementing the paper titled _Novel image compressionâ€“encryption hybrid algorithm based on key-controlled measurement matrix in compressive sensing_ by Nanrun Zhou, Aidi Zhang, Fen Zheng, and Lihua Gong.


## Set-up

The following is required to run the project.

- Python 3.6
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- opencv

I suggest installing using Anaconda. First, [download](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) Anaconda and install it.

Then, in command line, run the following:

`conda create -n py37 python=3.7`

`activate py37`

`conda install numpy scipy matplotlib opencv`
