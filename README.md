# comp6771
Novel image compressionâ€“encryption hybrid algorithm based on key-controlled measurement matrix in compressive sensing


## Set-up

The following is required to run the project.

- Python 3.6
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- opencv

I suggest installing using Anaconda. First, [download](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) Anaconda and install it.

Then, in command line, run the following:

`conda create -n py36 python=3.6`

`activate py36`

`conda install numpy scipy matplotlib opencv`
